                <li>Human blood pressure goes down when petting a dog. And so does the dogs.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Dogs are not color-blind. They can see blue and yellow.</li>
                <br>
                <li> All puppies are born deaf.</li>
                <br>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>A house cats genome is 95.6 percent tiger, and they share many behaviors with their jungle
                        ancestors, says Layla Morgan Wilde, a cat behavior expert and the founder of Cat Wisdom 101.
                        These behaviors include scent marking by scratching, prey play, prey stalking, pouncing,
                        chinning, and urine marking.</p>

                <li>
                    <p></p>Cats are believed to be the only mammals who dont taste sweetness.
                </li>

                    <p>Cats can jump up to six times their length</p>

                <br>
                <li>Cats make very little noise when they walk around. The thick, soft pads on their paws allow them to
                    sneak up on their prey — or you!</li>
                <br>
                <li>Some cats are ambidextrous, but 40 percent are either left- or right-pawed.</li>
